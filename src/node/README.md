# NodeJS OSC Services

Node services for the OSC messages.


## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies

Ensure you install these modules globally:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)


### Environment Variables

The application requires a few environment variables, however for security reasons, those cannot be included in the repository.

Instead, create a `.env` file at the root of the `src/node` directory in which you should assign the appropriate values to these entries:

    LOCAL_ADDRESS =
    LOCAL_PORT =
    MAX_ADDRESS =
    MAX_PORT =
    PROCESSING_ADDRESS =
    PROCESSING_PORT =
